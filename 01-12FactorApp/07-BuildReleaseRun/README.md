### **Build, Release, Run** in the 12-Factor App Methodology

The **Build, Release, Run** principle in the 12-Factor App methodology defines how an application should be deployed and run in a scalable, predictable, and reproducible manner. This principle emphasizes **strict separation** between the three main stages of deployment: **Build**, **Release**, and **Run**. By keeping these stages distinct, it ensures a streamlined deployment process, simplifies rollback procedures, and avoids unexpected changes during runtime.

#### **The Three Stages Explained:**

1. **Build Stage:**
   - **What Happens:** The build stage is where the raw source code is transformed into an executable artifact. This typically involves compiling the code and packaging it into a deployable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or binary file. During this stage, the application fetches any dependencies and compiles assets (like JavaScript, CSS, etc.).
   - **Purpose:** The primary goal of the build stage is to produce a versioned, reproducible artifact that can be deployed in various environments. It does not include configuration settings specific to any environment; the build is agnostic of those details.
   - **Example:** If you're working with a Java application, this stage would compile the Java code into a WAR file ready to be deployed to a server. Similarly, in a Node.js app, this stage might involve running a `webpack` build to bundle your JavaScript code.

2. **Release Stage:**
   - **What Happens:** The release stage is where the build artifact from the build stage is combined with the environment-specific configuration, such as database URLs, API keys, and other secrets or environment variables. This creates a **release**—a version of the app that’s ready to be deployed to a particular environment (e.g., production, staging).
   - **Purpose:** The release stage ensures that the final application is tailored for the environment it will run in. It integrates the code with external configuration and allows for dynamic environment-specific values (such as database credentials) to be applied without modifying the source code.
   - **Example:** The release stage for a web application could combine the WAR file from the build stage with the correct database configuration settings and environment-specific credentials (e.g., `DATABASE_URL` for production, `DATABASE_URL` for staging).

3. **Run Stage:**
   - **What Happens:** The run stage is the actual execution of the application in its runtime environment. This is when the application is launched and runs as a set of processes. These processes are often defined by the app’s specific needs (e.g., web processes, worker processes) and managed by a process manager.
   - **Purpose:** The run stage involves starting up the application and running it in the chosen execution environment (e.g., a cloud platform, a local server). Once the app is running, it may scale horizontally by adding more processes or instances as needed.
   - **Example:** This could involve running a Node.js app using `node server.js` or starting a Java-based application via `java -jar my-app.jar`.

#### **Strict Separation of Stages:**
- **Why Separate These Stages?**
   - **Prevents runtime changes:** Once the application is in the run stage, no changes to the codebase should be made. The code used in the build stage should be exactly the same as what is deployed in the run stage. The separation ensures that runtime issues are not caused by code changes happening unexpectedly.
   - **Simplifies rollback:** Since releases are versioned (often using timestamps or version numbers), it is easy to roll back to a previous release in case of failures, ensuring the application can return to a stable state quickly without disrupting ongoing processes.
   - **Consistency across environments:** By using this model, the app can move between different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) without introducing inconsistencies in the code or configuration. The same build artifact can be deployed in multiple environments with just the release stage varying according to environment-specific configuration.

#### **Benefits of Separation:**
1. **Reliability:** If a problem occurs in the run stage (e.g., the app crashes), it can be restarted without requiring code changes. Since code is fixed at the build stage, issues are typically isolated and easier to diagnose.
   
2. **Predictability:** Because the build, release, and run stages are defined and separate, you always know what code is running and what configuration is applied. The consistency makes troubleshooting easier.

3. **Reproducibility:** With strict separation, the app can be redeployed reliably in the future using the same build artifact. This is especially useful in large, distributed systems where consistency across different environments is critical.

4. **Scalability:** The process of building the code separately from the environment-specific configurations allows for easy scaling. For example, the same release can be deployed to multiple production instances without code changes, ensuring that the app works consistently in all instances.

#### **Examples in Practice:**

- **Java (Maven or Gradle):**
  - **Build:** Compiling the Java code and packaging it into a `.jar` or `.war` file.
  - **Release:** Integrating environment-specific properties such as database URLs or secret keys into the build artifact.
  - **Run:** Launching the Java application using `java -jar my-app.jar` on a server, with the app running against the environment-specific config.

- **Node.js:**
  - **Build:** Running `npm run build` to bundle and optimize JavaScript files.
  - **Release:** Setting environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`) via `env` or `.env` files before starting the app.
  - **Run:** Running the Node.js server with `node server.js`.

- **Ruby on Rails (using Capistrano or Heroku):**
  - **Build:** Running `bundle install` to install dependencies, and compiling assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS).
  - **Release:** Setting production-specific environment variables via `heroku config:set` or through Capistrano’s release management to define credentials and URLs.
  - **Run:** Starting the app via `rails s` or letting Heroku manage the app processes.

#### **Key Takeaways:**
- A **build** stage compiles the app into an executable format.
- A **release** stage combines the built artifact with environment-specific configurations.
- The **run** stage involves launching the app using the build and release and managing its execution.

This separation ensures that the app behaves predictably across environments, simplifies deployment, and supports horizontal scaling by keeping each stage distinct.
